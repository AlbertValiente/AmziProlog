<p>To pose a query at the listener you enter a goal pattern. The pattern of the 
  goal follows the same syntax as that of a Prolog fact:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">?- goal(argument_1, ..., argument_N).</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p> A goal is either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. In the listener this is represented 
  by either a <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.</p>
<p>Start a listener, reconsult <a href="../facts/amzi_air.pro">docs/alk/facts/amzi_air.pro</a>, 
  and try the following examples:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">
?- airport('I68', 'Lebanon, OH').
yes

?- airport('I68', 'Winder, GA').
no
</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <b>true</b> in Prolog means the goal can be matched in current Prolog 
  memory. <b>False</b> means the goal cannot be matched using the facts in current 
  Prolog memory.</p>
<p><b><i>NOTE ==&gt;</i></b> <i>This is called the <b>closed world assumption</b> 
  and is the topic of philosophical debates on accurate representation of truth 
  and falsity. It could be argued that true and unknown are more accurate states, 
  and falsity should be definitely known, just as truth is. Using logic programming, 
  one could create a reasoning system that recongnized three states: true, false, 
  and unknown.</i></p>
<h3>Logical Variables</h3>
<p>Goal patterns can include logical, or pattern-matching, variables. A goal with 
  a logical variable is true if there is a value the variable could have that 
  would make the goal true. In that case the variable takes that value.</p>
<p>Syntactically, a <b>logical variable</b> is indicated by an initial upper case 
  letter, or an underscore.</p>
<ul>
  <pre>
<font color="#000099">?- airport('I68', X).
X = 'Lebanon, OH' 
yes

?- airport(X, 'Winder, GA').
X = 'WDR' 
yes

?- airport(X, 'Los Angeles, CA').
no</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>When you try the above queries, you'll notice the cursor is left after the 
  value of logical variable is presented. Press the Enter key to end the query.</p>
<p>The first goal above asks the question: <i>Is there a value of X that makes 
  the goal airport('I68', X) true?</i> The listener responds with yes and the 
  value of X that makes the goal true.</p>
<p>The last goal asks: <i>Is there a value of X that makes the goal airport(X, 
  'Los Angeles, CA') true?</i> Since Los Angeles isn't included in docs/alk/facts/amzi_air.pro, 
  the answer is no.</p>
<h3>Compound Goals</h3>
<p>We can use the value of logical variable in a subsequent query goal. Here's 
  how we ask: <i>Is there a flight to 'Ann Arbor, MI' and if so what is its flight 
  number and origin?</i></p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
?- airport(ID, 'Ann Arbor, MI'), flight(Flight, From, ID).
ID = 'ARB'
Flight = aa17
From = 'I68' 
yes</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>The first goal above is true if the value of ID is 'ARB'. That value is then 
  used in the second goal, which is true if the values of Flight and From are 
  aa17 and 'I68'.</p>
<p>Notice that this is equivalent to a join operation in a relational database. 
  The airport and flight predicates are joined on the value of ID.</p>
<p>We could also find out the base_fare for that flight and the full name of the 
  origin airport:</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
?- airport(ToID, 'Ann Arbor, MI'), flight(F, FromID, ToID),
base_fare(F, Fare), airport(FromID, From).

ToID = 'ARB'
F = aa17
FromID = 'I68'
Fare = 60
From = 'Lebanon, OH' 

yes
</font></pre>
</ul>
<p><b><i>NOTE ==></i></b><i> The Amzi! IDE listener 'listens' to the <b>keyboard</b>, 
  and echoes the input to the screen. It does not pick up the goals from the screen. 
  This means if you make an editing mistake in a long query, such as the one above, 
  you cannot use the mouse or cursor arrows to correct the error. Doing so will 
  yield unexpected results. You can use the <b>backspace key to correct errors</b>, 
  and you can use <b>cut and paste</b> at the end of query, not the middle or 
  beginning.</i></p>
<h3>Multiple Answers</h3>
<p>In many cases, there might be multiple values of logical variable that makes 
  a goal pattern true. When a goal is first presented, the logical variables in 
  that goal take on values from the first fact that matches the goal pattern.</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
?- flight(F, 'WDR', To).

F = aa02
To = 'I68' </font> 
</pre>
</ul>
<p>As we've noticed, the listener leaves the cursor after the last variable. Pressing 
  Enter tells the listener we are happy with the result.</p>
<p>But, there might be more values of the logical variables that make the query 
  true. To find them, press the semi-colon (;) key.</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
?- flight(F, 'WDR', To).

F = aa02
To = 'I68' ;

F = aa03
To = 'SPG' ;
no</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>The final <b>no</b> means there were no more flight facts that matched the 
  goal pattern. In other words, there are two known flights from 'WDR', one to 
  'I68' and one to 'SPG'.</p>
<h3>Backtracking</h3>
<p>The mechanism Prolog uses to find multiple answers is called <b>backtracking</b>. 
  In the listener, the semi-colon (;) starts backtracking on the query goal.</p>
<p>First, values of logical variables are unbound, and the search for another 
  fact that matches the goal pattern begins at the next fact after the last one 
  found.</p>
<p>Backtracking works in complex goals as well. The backtracking mechanism is 
  applied to the right most goal first, and when all its solutions are exhausted, 
  backtracking starts in the previous goal. This process continues until all possible 
  solutions are found.</p>
<p>Here's a query that finds the airports you can get to from 'Winder, GA'.</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
?- airport(A, 'Winder, GA'), flight(F, A, ToID),
airport(ToID, To).

A = 'WDR'
F = aa02
ToID = 'I68'
To = 'Lebanon, OH' ;

A = 'WDR'
F = aa03
ToID = 'SPG'
To = 'St. Petersburg, FL' ;
no</font></pre>
</ul>
<p>Here's all the places you can fly to from 'Lebanon, OH' for $100:</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
?- airport(A, 'Lebanon, OH'), flight(F, A, ToID),
base_fare(F, 100), airport(ToID, To).

A = 'I68'
F = aa01
ToID = 'WDR'
To = 'Winder, GA' ;

A = 'I68'
F = aa11
ToID = 'UNV'
To = 'State College, PA' ;

A = 'I68'
F = aa19
ToID = 'EZF'
To = 'Fredericksburg, VA' ;

A = 'I68'
F = aa21
ToID = 'CPK'
To = 'Norfolk, VA' ;
no</font></pre>
</ul>
<p>Notice in this query that backtracking can be initiated by failure of one of 
  the goals in the query. Consider the second flight in the logic base from 'I68'.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre><font color="#000099">flight(aa10, 'I68', '1A0').</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When the <b>flight(F, A, ToID)</b> goal backtracks to this fact, the value 
  of F is bound with the flight number, in this case aa10. That value is then 
  used in the next goal, <b>base_fare(F, 100)</b>. But <b>base_fare(aa10, 100)</b> 
  is false. This cause Prolog to backtrack into <b>flight/3</b> again to find 
  the next flight. This continues until another flight with a fare of 100 is found.</p>
<h3>Tracing Queries</h3>
<p>The listener includes a debugger that traces the goals in a query. It can be 
  used to better understand exactly how Prolog satisfies a query.</p>
<p>The debugger uses four terms to describe different states at a goal in a compound 
  query. These are often called ports.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>CALL</b> - A goal is being called for the first time, or more precisely 
    from a previous goal. Because of backtracking, a goal might be CALLed multiple 
    times as previous goals get new solutions.</li>
  <li><b>EXIT</b> - A goal is true, and the unbound variables are bound to the 
    values that make it true. The next goal is then CALLed.</li>
  <li><b>REDO</b> - A goal is being backtracked into, or more precisely being 
    activated from a following failed goal. The variables that were unbound when 
    the goal was CALLed are unbound again and a new solution looked for. If found, 
    the goal will EXIT again, if not it will FAIL.</li>
  <li><b>FAIL</b> - A goal has no more solutions, and the previous goal will be 
    backtracked into, i.e. REDO.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how to set up the debugger for the last compound query:</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
?- debug.

??- airport(A, 'Lebanon, OH'), flight(F, A, ToID),
base_fare(F, 100), airport(ToID, To).</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>In the IDE, the debugger starts in a separate window. In the command line listener, 
  alis, the debugger output appears as part of the listener dialog.</p>
<p>Here's an annotated listing from the debugger for the first two solutions from 
  the query. The simplist way to use the debugger is to <b>creep</b> from port 
  to port. In the IDE, this is done using the <b>creep</b> button. In the command 
  line listener, a question mark (?) follows each line, and entering the letter 
  'c' after it creeps to the next port.</p>
<table BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=3 >
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 
    <p>The double ??- indicates a debugger prompt, rather than a
	normal listener prompt.</p>  
        <pre>
??- airport(A, 'Lebanon, OH'), flight(F, A, ToID),
base_fare(F, 100), airport(ToID, To).</pre>
        
      <p> Variable names are not preserved in the debugger, but instead internal 
        heap locations are provided. For more advanced debugging, this is good, 
        but for a relatively simple case it adds some confusion. In this next 
        line we see our variable 'A' is at heap location 383.<br>
        </p>
        
      <pre>[] CALL user:airport(H383, 'Lebanon, OH') ? c</pre>
      <p> Prolog tries and succeeds (EXITs) from the first clause, indicated by 
        the (1), of airport/2. H383, our 'A', is bound to 'I68'.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] trying (1)user:airport('I68', 'Lebanon, OH')
[] EXIT (1)user:airport('I68', 'Lebanon, OH') ? c</pre>
      <p> The next goal, flight/3 is then called, with the second argument bound 
        to 'I68'. It succeeds using the first (1) clause from flight/3, and the 
        variables H389 ('F') and H391 ('ToID') are bound to aa01 and 'WDR'.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] CALL user:flight(H389, 'I68', H391) ? c
[] trying (1)user:flight(aa01, 'I68', 'WDR')
[] EXIT (1)user:flight(aa01, 'I68', 'WDR') ? c</pre>
      <p>Now base_fare/2 is called. Notice that our variable 'F' is bound already 
        bound to aa01 and that is reflected in the way the debugger displays the 
        CALL. <br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] CALL user:base_fare(aa01, 100) ? c
[] trying (1)user:base_fare(aa01, 100)
[] EXIT (1)user:base_fare(aa01, 100) ? c</pre>
      <p>The base_fare for aa01 is 100, so base_fare EXITs. A second goal for 
        airport/2 is started, looking for the name associated with 'WDR'. That 
        succeeds with the second (2) clause of airport/2.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] CALL user:airport('WDR', H404) ? c
[] trying (2)user:airport('WDR', 'Winder, GA')
[] EXIT (2)user:airport('WDR', 'Winder, GA') ? c</pre>
      <p>And all the values of the variables, with our names back, are displayed. 
        With the command line listener, the display is embedded in the debugging 
        output as shown here. With the IDE the output would appear in the listener 
        window. <br>
      </p>
      <pre>
A = 'I68'
F = aa01
ToID = 'WDR'
To = 'Winder, GA' ;</pre>
      <p>A semicolon (;) as always triggers backtracking. The last predicate called 
        is backtracked (REDO) into first. That was the last call to airport/2, 
        looking for the airport name associated with 'WDR'.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] REDO user:airport('WDR', 'Winder, GA') ? c
[] FAIL user:airport('WDR', H404) ? c</pre>
      <p>It fails because there was only one clause with airport('WDR', To). Notice 
        on failure, the variable H404 (our 'To') is now unbound. Backtracking 
        (REDO) now proceeds into the previous goal, base_fare/2.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] REDO user:base_fare(aa01, 100) ? c
[] FAIL user:base_fare(aa01, 100) ? c</pre>
      <p>It fails because there was only one base_fare(aa01, 100). Backtracking 
        (REDO) goes back to the previous goal, flight(F, 'I68', ToID).<br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] REDO user:flight(aa01, 'I68', 'WDR') ? c
[] trying (10)user:flight(aa10, 'I68', '1A0')
[] EXIT (10)user:flight(aa10, 'I68', '1A0') ? c</pre>
      <p>It succeeds using clause ten (10). This starts forward motion again with 
        a CALL to base_fare/2, checking the fare for flight aa10.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] CALL user:base_fare(aa10, 100) ? c
[] FAIL user:base_fare(aa10, 100) ? c</pre>
      <p>But that's not the fare for aa10, so it failed, triggering backtracking 
        (REDO) into flight/3 again. flight/3 succeeds (EXIT) again with clause 
        11. <br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] REDO user:flight(aa10, 'I68', '1A0') ? c
[] trying (11)user:flight(aa11, 'I68', 'UNV')
[] EXIT (11)user:flight(aa11, 'I68', 'UNV') ? c</pre>
      <p>And this fare is 100.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>[] CALL user:base_fare(aa11, 100) ? c
[] trying (11)user:base_fare(aa11, 100)
[] EXIT (11)user:base_fare(aa11, 100) ? c
[] CALL user:airport('UNV', H404) ? c
[] trying (8)user:airport('UNV', 'State College, PA')
[] EXIT (8)user:airport('UNV', 'State College, PA') ? c</pre>
      <p>And the second airport that met the query is displayed.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>
A = 'I68'
F = aa11
ToID = 'UNV'
To = 'State College, PA'</pre>
      <p>Hitting enter rather than semi-colon (;) accepted the result, stopping 
        the listener from triggering further backtracking.<br>
      </p>
      <pre>yes
