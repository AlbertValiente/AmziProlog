<p>Prolog comes from the same theoretical roots as relational databases. A Prolog 
  logic base is composed of facts and rules.</p>
<p>Facts in Prolog are similar in form to rows of a relational database table. 
  Unlike a database, Prolog facts are stored as text in a Prolog source file. 
  They can be indexed, sorted or compiled for faster runtime access.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of facts from an application for a sample airline, Amzi! 
  Air:</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">airport('I68', 'Lebanon, OH').
airport('WDR', 'Winder, GA').
airport('SPG', 'St. Petersburg, FL').
airport('M22', 'Russellville, AL').
airport('1A0', 'Soddy Daisy, TN').</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>They relate airport identifiers with the names of the towns the airport services.</p>
<p>Here are some facts about Amzi! Air flight numbers and departure and arrival 
  airports:</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
flight(aa01, 'I68', 'WDR').
flight(aa03, 'WDR', 'SPG').
flight(aa05, 'SPG', 'M22').</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Prolog Jargon</h3>
A Prolog fact is of the form:
<ul>
  <pre>
<font color="#000099">predicate_name(argument_1, ..., argument_N).</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>A <b>predicate</b> is a collection of facts, each having the same predicate_name 
  and the same number of arguments. It corresponds to a table in a relational 
  database.</p>
<p>The <b>arity</b> of a predicate is the number of arguments. This corresponds 
  to the number of columns in a relational table.</p>
<p>A predicate is often represented by predicate/arity. So the two examples above 
  are <b>airport/2</b> and <b>flight/3</b>.</p>
<p>A fact is more formally called a <b>clause</b> in Prolog. So above we show 
  three <b>clauses</b> of <b>flight/3</b>.</p>
<h3>Prolog Term Types</h3>
<p>Unlike a database, Prolog facts are <b>typeless</b>. The arguments can be any 
  type of term allowed in Prolog. Two common types are <b>atoms</b> and <b>numbers</b>.</p>
<p><b>Atoms</b> contain text that is stored internally in an atom table, allowing 
  for very fast pattern matching as predicates are searched. Some atoms from the 
  above examples are:</p>
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
'I68'
'Lebanon, OH'
aa01</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>Any characters (ASCII, multibyte or wide Unicode) enclosed in single quotes 
  are atoms. The quotes are not necessary if the atom is composed of all letters 
  and the initial letter is lower case.</p>
<p><b>Numbers</b> are integers or decimals or floating point. Here are some facts 
  about base airfares in the Amzi! Air logic base:</p>
  
<ul>
  <pre><font color="#000099">
base_fare(aa03, 100).
base_fare(aa04, 100).
base_fare(aa05, 90).
base_fare(aa06, 90).</font>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>In this <b>base_fare/2</b> predicate, the second argument is an integer representing 
  the fare.</p>
<p>For the examples, it makes sense that each argument holds the same type of 
  term, but that is not necessary in Prolog, as will be seen later on in the tutorial.</p>
<p><b><i>NOTE ==&gt;</i></b><i> In actual applications, factual knowledge as shown 
  here might be stored in a Prolog logic base, or might be accessed from external 
  data stores. Either approach works well with Amzi! as will be described later 
  in the tutorial.</i></p>
<h3>Prolog Text</h3>
<p>The facts are stored in text files. They can be edited using any program editor. 
  The Amzi! IDE contains an editor.</p>
<p>You can open the file <a href="amzi_air.pro">alk/facts/amzi_air.pro</a> to 
  see more of the facts that will be used in the Amzi! Air sample application.</p>
<p>The next section discusses how to use the facts.</p>
