<p>Prolog facts and rules can be used to represent logical knowledge that is relatively 
  formal in nature. Many types of business rules, such as pricing, workflow and 
  underwriting rules fall in this catagory, as do many types of government and 
  organization rules and regulations.</p>
<p><img src="logic_base_architecture.gif" width="286" height="156" align="right" border="0">The 
  facts and rules of the application area are stored in a logic base. The rules 
  are applied to specific cases. An application sets up a case by asserting dynamic 
  facts to the logic base. The application can then query the logic base and get 
  the results for that particular case.</p>
<p>For example, a logic base might contain the facts and rules for pricing an 
  air line ticket. The application using that logic base would first assert the 
  particulars of the flight, say dates and destination, and then query the logic 
  base to get the fare.</p>
<p>Prolog comes from the same theoretical roots as relational database. Prolog 
  facts are similar to rows of relational tables. Prolog queries are like database 
  queries, and Prolog rules are like saved queries.</p>
<p>The primary difference between a logic base and a database is focus. The main 
  focus of a database is data. The main focus of a logic base is logical relationships, 
  or rules.</p>
<p>A logic base can hold a fair amount of data (logical facts). It's rules can 
  also reason over data in external databases.</p>
<p>This section of the tutorial will show how to:</p>
<ul>
  <li> use Prolog to represent the static facts and rules of a logic base,</li>
  <li>test the logic base in the Amzi! Interactive Development Environment (IDE), 
    and </li>
  <li>deploy the logic base as an application component.</li>
</ul>
