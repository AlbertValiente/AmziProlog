<h2>Applying Logical Knowledge</h2>
<p>A tutorial on applying logical knowledge using Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server.</p>
<p>Some common known facts about Prolog are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's easy to use Prolog for implementing rules.</li>
  <li>Prolog can only represent certain types of precise formal knowledge.</li>
  <li>Prolog is difficult to learn.</li>
  <li>You can represent any type of knowledge and reasoning in Prolog.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all true, and can be understood if you divide Prolog into two aspects, 
  logic base and logic programming.</p>
<p>The logic base aspect of Prolog is easy to learn and use, and is a powerful 
  tool for representing knowledge that is precise in nature. Examples of this 
  type of knowledge are pricing, underwriting, workflow, benefits and regulations.</p>
<p>Less precise knowledge, such as used for diagnostic types of applications, 
  does not fit as well into a Prolog logic base, nor does knowledge used to create 
  complex results, such as configuration and planning.</p>
<p>The logic programming aspect of Prolog makes it easy to implement those more 
  difficult applications. Any sort of knowledge and reasoning can be implemented 
  using logic programming.</p>
<p>Logic programming takes a while to get used to, but once learned is an extremely 
  powerful tool.</p>
