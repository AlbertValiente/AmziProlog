<h1>Matrices</h1>

<p>Matrix algebra could be introduced to Prolog by implementing a data type
<strong>matrix</strong> and extending the arithmetic operators to recognise
it. The only drawback would be that applications would not be portable.</p>

<p>We present here some matrix primitives when there is no
<strong>matrix</strong> type and matrices are represented as nested lists.</p>

<p>Let: [[A11, A12, ... , A1n], [A21, A22, ... , [A2n], ... [An1, An2, ... ,
Ann]] denote a matrix in row-major order</p>

<p>This implies that a simple list denotes a row vector and a list of row
vectors is a matrix. By this definition a row vector is not a matrix and no
denotation is provided for a column vector. However, a column vector can be
represented by a matrix of singleton lists [[A1k], [A2k], ... , [Ank]] and
similarly a row vector by:the matrix: [[Ak1, Ak2, ... , Akn]]. To perform
matrix operations on vectors these are the denotations that should be
used.</p>

<h3>ijth/4</h3>

<p>ijth(A, I, J, AIJ) AIJ is the element at the Ith row and Jth column of
A.</p>

<h3>rbind/3</h3>

<p>rbind(A, B, C) appends the rows of B to the rows of A, to produce C,
provided A and B are conforming matrices.</p>

<p>rbind(K, B, C) if K is a number, appends the rows of B to a conforming row
of Ks to produce C.</p>

<p>rbind(A, K, C) if K is a number, appends a conforming row of Ks to the
rows of A produce C.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>cbind/3</h3>

<p>cbind(A, B, C) appends the columns of B to the columns of A, to produce C,
provided A and B are conforming matrices.</p>

<p>cbind(K, B, C) if K is a number, appends the columns of B to a conforming
column of Ks to produce C.</p>

<p>cbind(A, K, C) if K is a number, appends a conforming column of Ks to the
columns of A to produce C.</p>

<p>pivCon(A, Vector)    Vector is the pivotal condensation of A, as a column
vector. If A is square Vector is one element.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There is a new arithmetic operator <strong>sub</strong> (precedence 200)
which performs matrix subscription:</p>

<p>A <strong>sub</strong> [ I, *] returns the Ith row of A,</p>

<p>A <strong>sub</strong> [*, J] returns the Jth column of A,</p>

<p>A <strong>sub</strong> [I, J] returns the element of A at row I column
J,</p>

<p>A <strong>sub</strong> [I] returns the Ith element of vector A regardless
of whether it is a row or a column vector,</p>

<p>where I and J are integers.</p>
